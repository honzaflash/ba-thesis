# Game Development in Hskell

## Code

- ## hAsteroids
    clone of Atari Asteroids using Apecs library

    ### Main missing parts
    - Displaying score
    - Aliens
    - Asteroids breaking into smaller parts

- ## pure-asteroids
    clone of Atari Asteroids with focus on
    safe pure functions

    Currently only part of the world structure 
    is defined, keyboard input is not yet implemented, rendering is WIP but portion of the game logic and architecture is done.

    it now renderes the ship rotating, moving across the space
    and 100 asteroids rendered as dots flying around colliding with the ship
